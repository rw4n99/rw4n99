<h2 align="left">Q&A</h2>

###

<p align="left">✨ Why the change?<br>After starting out in teaching, I have realised that I love learning! While Teaching English in Spain offered me opportunities to constantly reflect on myself and grow, I didn't feel challenged. So, I decided to take on a huge challenge and started my first role in Tech at the School of Code!<br><br>In 2020, I was awarded with a First Class degree BA (hons) in Education, and an MA in the same field. I miss researching, studying, and producing good quality work that I'm proud of!<br><br>👨‍🎓 How has SoC prepared you to work in Tech?<br>I have learned a lot of skills in full-stack development! Each week, we've been working in an intensive internship that has focussed on an area in tech - from front end to back end, I've learned how to make and scale full-stack programs in just 12 weeks 🎉<br><br>🎲 Fun fact: I have just moved back to England after living in Madrid for 2 years!</p>
